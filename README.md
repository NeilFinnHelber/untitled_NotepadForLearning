This app is meant to be used for learning.<br>
A user can create ```pages``` for projects or learning subjects.<br>

Inside the ```pages``` a user can create as many ```headers``` and ```subheaders``` as they please.<br>

This should help to split subjects into clear legible parts that the user can look through if they need it later.
